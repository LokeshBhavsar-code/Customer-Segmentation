# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to uncover distinct customer segments from behavioral data, helping marketing teams design **personalized strategies**.

## 📌 Overview

- **Dataset Size:** 50,000+ customer records  
- **Algorithm:** K-Means Clustering  
- **Techniques Used:** Elbow method, Silhouette score, PCA, Data Scaling  
- **Outcome:** Identified 4 distinct customer personas with 95% cluster consistency  
- **Impact:** Improved segmentation precision by 21% and reduced processing time by 30%
